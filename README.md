RightBet are national bookmakers who provide customers with multiple ways of placing bets on a variety of different sports. They are looking at introducing new software for customers to prepare their own bets for the upcoming Aintree Racing Weekend in April for people who want to bet on the winners only. They have brought in a programming company to do this for them.
 You are to produce a betting programme that allows people to select horses they think will win in the Aintree Grand National 2016. The programme will need to do a number of different things:
 • Provide a list of the 40 horses that will be running the race with the racing odds 
 • Allow the user to input the horses number or name to add them onto their bet slip
 • Allow the user to put a betting stake on multiple horses
 • Calculate the potential winnings based on if the horse wins or places
 • Output a bet slip with; 
 o Name of the bookmakers
 o Name of the horse and the odds
 o Stake and Potential winnings for each horse
 o Time and Date the bet slip was printed
 o The total amount of money staked (e.g. 4 bets placed all of £5 must output £20)
 Key Information
 • A win bet is calculated by multiplying the odds of the horse by the stake that is made + the original stake e.g. a win bet of £5 placed on a horse at 5/1 will be calculated by doing 5 x £5 + original stage
 • The user must have a bet receipt that prints on the page once all of the required information has been provided
 • The list of horses must be imported as a separate file as the list is likely to change as it gets closer to the race day
 • The list of horses and their odds have been provided to you
 • The user may want to put a bet on multiple horses to win – they can put on a maximum of 8 win bets.
